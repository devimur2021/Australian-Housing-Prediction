## General Information

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- Dataset         : train.csv
- Data Dictionay  : Data_Description.pdf

## Objective
Build a Model to identify variables influencing Pricing of Housing unit by Area. To understand the pricing dynamics in a new market
The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
